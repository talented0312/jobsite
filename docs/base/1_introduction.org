Ethlance is a Freelancing dApp, which is used to orchestrate the use
of smart contracts to make mutual agreements between employers,
employees, and a median / an arbiter.

* Rationale
  [[https://ethlance.com][Ethlance]] is a tried and tested product, which needs a rejuvenation
  for the adoption of scalable and more easy to use dApp concepts and
  technologies. The replacement product, dubbed Ethlance 2.0, will
  make efforts to make freelancing a safe, reliable, and secure
  process between potential employers and employees. By also
  supporting other freelancing listings, we also present the
  opportunity to find work beyond ethlance within other dApp domains.
