- All 3 user roles (Employer, Candidate, Arbiter) can be registered
  from the same Ethereum address.

- When creating a job, an employer specifies following options:
  - Employer chooses if it's a regular job or a bounty. For a regular
    job, candidates might submit a job proposal without any prior work done
    for that job. For a bounty, candidates submit finished work
    without having to submit job proposal first.
  - Employer fills out job category, required skills, job description
  - Employer chooses form of a payment. It can be Ether or arbitrary
    ERC20 token, given the token address.
  - Employers choose whether they want to add an arbiter for each
    individual job that they have created. If they choose to add an
    arbiter, they will specify a fixed amount of Ether they are
    willing to pay for an arbiter's services. They can choose
    multiple arbiters from a list, who will be invited for the job. An
    arbiter who accepts the invitation first, will be resolving a job
    dispute, in case there's a dispute. Arbiter receives his fee
    immediately after he accepts the invitation.
  - For a regular job, employer has option to transfer any amount of
    Ether or token to a job contract at the time of job creation. This
    will help increase credibility of a job, since once funds are help
    by job contract, an arbiter has priviledges to transfer funds to
    condidates.
  - For a bounty, employer also specifies amount of Ether or token
    that will be paid out for successful work submissions. This amount
    will be transferred from employer's wallet to a job contract at
    the time of job creation.

- When proposing for a job, a candidate specifies following options:
  - For regular job, he specifies his rate and writes proposal text.
  - For bounty, he specifies fixed amount, which he claims for
    submitting work, writes explanation and attaches files if needed.

- Once job proposal or bounty work are submitted, a Job Contract page
  gets available for all 3 involved users: employer, candidate,
  arbiter. Job Contract page has form of a message conversation
  between involved users. These are events on which a new message can
  be added into job contract conversation:
  - Employer invites candidate to apply for the job
  - Candidate applies for the job
  - Candidate submits work done for the bounty
  - Employer hires a candidate
  - Employer/Candidate/Arbiter submits a message
  - Candidate submits an invoice for accomplished work
  - Employer pays for the invoice
  - Employer/Candidate raises a dispute
  - Arbiter resolves a dispute. During dispute resolution, the arbiter
    specifies amounts that will be sent to candidate and employer,
    from funds held in a job contract.
  - Employer/Candidate/Arbiter leaves feedback for Employer/Candidate/Arbiter

- The app provides option for anyone to sponsor a job, which means
  transferring funds into a job contract. In case user changes his
  mind about sponsoring, he can refund himself his contribution, in
  case it wasn't spent yet.

- For all users, the app provides list of jobs/candidates/arbiters
  with various filtering options as specified in designs.

- For employers, the app provides following lists:
  - My Jobs - Jobs created by an employer.
  - My Contracts - Job Contracts the employer is involved in.
  - My Invoices - Invoices, which the employer paid or is supposed to pay.

- For candidate, the app provides following lists:
  - My Jobs - Jobs candidate applied for
  - My Contracts - Job Contracts the candidate is involved in.
  - My Invoices - Invoices, which candidate sent to an employer

- For arbiter, the app provides following lists:
  - My Disputes - Disputes the arbiter is or was involved in.
  - My Contracts - Job Contracts the arbiter is involved in.
  - My Invoices - Invoices with payments arbiter received for dispute
    resolution.
